# Age of Voxel: Godot 4 port (shared contract)

The browser build (`src/`, Vite + Three.js, see `../ARCHITECTURE.md`) stays in
the repo untouched as the reference. This directory is the Godot 4.5.1 port
(Forward+), targeting Windows, macOS, Linux and web. Read this file before you
change anything here, and keep it accurate when you change something it
describes.

## Decisions (fixed by the lead)

- **Simulation in C++** (GDExtension in `native/`, godot-cpp 4.5): everything
  the JS does in `update()` at the fixed 30 Hz tick, deterministic, seeded RNG.
  C# cannot export to web in Godot 4, and GDScript is too slow for 2000 units.
- **Rendering, animation, effects, input and UI in GDScript + shaders**
  (`game/`), reading sim state through packed arrays once per frame.
- Sim code under `native/src/sim/` is plain C++17 with **no Godot includes**.
  `native/src/aov_sim.{h,cpp}` (class `AovSim`) is the only binding layer:
  thin getters that copy sim state into `PackedFloat32Array` /
  `PackedInt32Array` / `PackedByteArray`, and commands that forward to the sim.

## Layout and ownership

One directory per piece, mirroring the JS pieces (`src/<piece>/`). Only edit
your own directories; use other pieces' public API (documented at the top of
their main file) or ask their owner. Shared code is in `game/core/` and
`native/src/sim/core/` (owner: foundation).

| Piece | GDScript (render / UI) | C++ sim (`native/src/sim/…`) | JS reference |
|---|---|---|---|
| core (foundation) | `game/main.gd`, `game/core/` (args, scenes, camera, model loader, voxel shader, bench, sim_debug, simcheck) | `core/` (constants, rng, jsmath, game_map, entities, players, events, spatial_hash, pathfinding, movement, commands, profile; later fog, victory), `sim.{h,cpp}` | `src/core/` |
| terrain | `game/terrain/terrain.gd` (foundation first pass: C++ mesher, flat water plane ws*5 centred like Water.js, resource MultiMeshes) | map edits live in `core/game_map`; resource nodes `Sim::spawn_resource` | `src/terrain/` |
| lighting | `game/lighting/lighting.gd` (currently a foundation **placeholder**) | none | `src/lighting/` |
| buildings | `game/buildings/buildings.gd` | `buildings/` | `src/buildings/` |
| units | `game/units/units.gd` | `units/` (defs, spawn, anim state, spread: ported) | `src/units/` |
| combat (incl. enemy AI) | `game/combat/combat.gd` | `combat/` | `src/combat/` |
| economy | `game/economy/economy.gd` | `economy/` | `src/economy/` |
| godpowers | `game/godpowers/godpowers.gd` | `godpowers/` | `src/godpowers/` |
| ui (HUD, selection, input) | `game/ui/ui.gd` | none | `src/ui/` |
| scenes | `AovScenes.set_setup()` from the owning piece | `scenes/` (deterministic scene setups) | `src/core/scenes/`, `BattleScene.js`, `EconomyScene.js` |

Git does not keep empty directories: create yours when you add its first file.

## Build

```
git submodule update --init godot/native/godot-cpp     # CI / fresh clone
cd godot/native && scons -j2                           # linux, template_debug
scons -j2 target=template_release                      # release build
```

`SConstruct` links the prebuilt `godot-cpp/bin/libgodot-cpp.<platform>.<target>.*`
when it exists (`build_library=no`), so only our sources compile (a few
seconds). A fresh clone has no prebuilt library and builds it (~1700 files,
tens of minutes on 2 cores); `build_library=yes` forces that. In this
container the submodule checkout is hard-linked from `/opt/godot-cpp` (already
built): do not rebuild it. Use `-j2`: the machine is shared.

The sim is compiled with `-ffp-contract=off` (MSVC `/fp:precise`): no FMA
contraction, never `-ffast-math`, or it stops matching the browser.

Web: the extension must be built with emscripten (`platform=web`, dlink) and
exported with "Extensions Support" on; not set up yet.

**Godot only loads a GDExtension listed in `.godot/extension_list.cfg`**,
which an import writes. After a fresh clone (or if `AovSim` is missing):

```
godot --headless --path godot --import     # may print a crash on first run; the cache is written anyway
```

`scripts/godot-shoot.mjs` does this automatically when the file is missing.
`.godot/` is never committed.

## Run, capture, bench

The main scene reads user args after `--`, mirroring the browser URL params:

```
godot --path godot -- --scene=town [--seed=N] [--mapsize=N] [--units=N] [--players=2..6]
      [--live=0|1] [--hud=0|1] [--fog=0|1] [--timescale=N] [--cam=x,z[,dist[,pitch[,yaw]]]]
      [--width=W --height=H] [--out=shots/town.png] [--frames=N] [--quit] [--timeout=S]
```

- `--out`: after `--frames` rendered frames (default 4, like `main.js`) save
  the viewport as PNG, print `AOV_CAPTURE {json}` and quit (exit 3 if the frame
  is blank: mean < 8 or std < 4 over a 160x90 downscale, as `shoot.mjs`).
- `--quit`: same without saving. A watchdog quits (exit 4) after `--timeout`
  seconds (default 600) so a script error never hangs a capture.
- Scenes: `skirmish town battle godpower coast economy hud stress` (same
  presets, seeds, map sizes and cameras as the JS registry) and the Godot-only
  `models` (every exported model on one strip).

Capture (xvfb + lavapipe software Vulkan; there is no GPU here):

```
node scripts/godot-shoot.mjs --scene town --out shots/godot/town.png [--width 1920 --height 1080]
     [--seed N] [--params "units=500&cam=64,64,30"] [--frames 4] [--timeout 300] [--verbose]
```

It runs `VK_ICD_FILENAMES=/usr/share/vulkan/icd.d/lvp_icd.json xvfb-run -a -s
"-screen 0 WxHx24" godot --path godot --rendering-driver vulkan --audio-driver
Dummy --resolution WxH -- …`, and exits non-zero on a GDScript / engine error,
a missing extension, a timeout or a blank frame. Compare with
`reference/browser/<scene>.png` (same scene, seed and camera).

Bench (headless, sim only):

```
node scripts/godot-stress.mjs [--units 250,500,1000,2000,3000,4000] [--ticks 600] [--warmup 150] [--json out.json]
godot --headless --path godot -- --scene=stress --units=2000 --bench --ticks=600 --warmup=150 --json=/tmp/b.json
```

`godot-stress.mjs` prints exactly the tables of `scripts/stress.mjs` (its
summarize/print code is copied unchanged), fed by `game/core/bench.gd`, which
steps `AovSim.tick()` with the profiler on and reads `AovSim.get_profile()`
(`{total, sys:{name:ms}, sub:{}, ai:{player:ms}, calls:{name:[n, ms]}}`) and
`get_stats()` (`{alive, dead, moving, buildings, projectiles}`). **Sim pieces
must fill these**: time each system of the sim order with
`ScopedTimer t(prof.enabled ? &prof.sys["movement"] : nullptr);` (names as in
the JS `game.simOrder`), AI players under `prof.ai`, counted calls
(`findPath`, `nearestResource`, …) under `prof.calls`.

Other tools:

```
node scripts/check-mapgen.mjs            # C++ vs JS generateMap() for every scene's seed/preset: heights, ground,
                                         # passability, walkable after resources, resources, starts (all "ok")
node scripts/check-sim.mjs [--only a,b]  # C++ sim vs the JS modules: scenarios (skirmish 3, town 7, battle 19, coast 5,
                                         # stress 2000 and 4200 units) spawn, order, step up to 1350 ticks and compare
                                         # every unit bit for bit at every checkpoint (all "ok"); ~3 min
node scripts/export-models.mjs           # re-export godot/assets/models from the JS model code (~5 s)
godot --headless --path godot -s res://game/core/simcheck.gd -- --mapdump=F | --scenario=F --out=F   # their C++ side
```

Sim debug view: `--simdebug=1` draws every unit as a box in its owner's
colour (on by default while `game/units/units.gd` does not exist);
`--simdemo=1 [--simdemo_t=7]` spawns two armies at the first two starts and
marches them onto each other, e.g.
`node scripts/godot-shoot.mjs --scene skirmish --params "simdemo=1"`.

## Conventions

- **World units**: 1 tile = 1 world unit, terrain voxel `VOXEL = 0.5` (2x2
  columns per tile), map heights in voxel levels (`y = level * 0.5`), water
  surface at `(waterLevel - 0.3) * 0.5`. Buildings use 0.25 voxels, units
  0.07-0.15 (per rig), trees/props 0.18. Y up, same axes as Three.js (both
  right-handed, Y up, -Z forward), so JS positions and rotations carry over
  unchanged. Unit facing is +z at rot 0, like the JS.
- **Camera**: `AovCameraRig` (`game/core/camera_rig.gd`) is
  `CameraController.js`: vertical fov 34, near 0.5, far 900, target / distance /
  pitch / yaw in the same units; `set_view({x, z, distance, pitch, yaw})` takes
  degrees like `setView`. Scene cameras in `game/core/scenes.gd` use the JS
  numbers, so captures line up with `reference/browser/<scene>.png`. Where a JS
  camera is relative to the setup's focus (`ctx.focus`), the scene setup must
  return `{"focus": Vector2(x, z)}`; until it exists the focus falls back to
  player 1's start tile centre.
- **Determinism**: sim randomness only from the sim's seeded `aov::RNG`
  (mulberry32, bit-exact with `src/core/rng.js`, including `hash2/hash3` and
  `Noise2D`); visual randomness from hashes. Port JS arithmetic faithfully:
  doubles, `Math.round` = `aov::js_round` (floor(x + 0.5)), `| 0` =
  `aov::js_int32`, Float32Array values stored as `float`, and **the JS Math
  functions from `core/jsmath.h`**: `jsm::atan2 / sin / cos / atan` (V8's
  fdlibm) and `jsm::hypot` (V8's scaled sum). glibc's differ in the last bit
  for 3-17 % of inputs, enough to make a battle drift. Iterate entities in
  row order (= id order = JS Map order). `generate_map` and the whole core
  (entities, units update / spread, pathfinding, movement, commands) are
  bit-exact with the browser (`check-mapgen.mjs`, `check-sim.mjs`); extend
  `check-sim.mjs` with your system's scenario when you port one.
- **Entity store** (`sim/core/entities.h`): struct-of-arrays per kind
  (`entities.units / buildings / resources`), one id counter, ids never
  reused, `id_slot`/`id_kind` map an id to its row. Rows are dense in id
  order; `remove()` only flags the row (`removed`), and rows are compacted
  once per tick right before Movement rebuilds the spatial hash, so a row
  index is stable for a whole tick (the hash stores rows). Skip `removed`
  rows in loops. Pieces add per-entity fields as columns in the X-macro lists
  (`AOV_UNIT_COLUMNS` …; prefix private ones with the piece name). Orders
  live in `order_type / order_target / order_x / order_z / order_a..c`;
  register a handler per order type with `sim.commands.register_handler()`.
  Animation requests: set `units.anim_want[row]` each tick (`A_GATHER` …).
- **Paths**: `Movement::move_to(row, x, z, rect, range)` like `moveTo`;
  waypoints live in `sim.paths` (a pool, handle per unit). `Pathfinder`
  caches A* results per (start tile, goal tile, rect) while walkability is
  unchanged (`GameMap::pass_version`, bumped by `block` / passability):
  exact. Two opt-in scalers that are NOT bit-exact with the browser, off by
  default: `AovSim.set_group_paths(n)` (formation moves of >= n units share
  one Dijkstra field: 360 units into a forest 544 ms -> 30 ms) and
  `AovSim.set_repath_budget(n)` (max stuck re-paths per tick, the rest wait).
  Interactive play (the ui piece) should turn group paths on (~24);
  deterministic captures and parity checks leave them off.
- **Sim / render split**: GDScript never mutates sim state directly; it calls
  `AovSim` commands. Per frame, pieces pull packed arrays (positions, rotations,
  anim state, hp, …) with one call each, never per entity. The sim keeps the
  previous tick's positions so renderers interpolate with `game.alpha` (1
  while paused). `AovSim.take_map_changes()` returns dirty column rects
  (cx0, cz0, cx1, cz1) since the last call (the JS `map.onChange`); only the
  terrain piece drains it. Sim events are drained once per frame by
  `main.gd` into `game.events` (an Array of Dictionaries, see below): read
  that in `frame()`, never call `take_events()` yourself.
- **Voxel models**: exported once from the JS builders by
  `scripts/export-models.mjs` into `assets/models/<group>.json` + `.bin.gz`
  (groups: units, buildings, construction, props, resources, details,
  economy, combat); never hand-edit, re-run the exporter after changing a JS
  `models.js`. Load with `VoxelModels.mesh(group, name)` (an `ArrayMesh`, cached).
  Vertex data: `CUSTOM0` = sRGB albedo with the per-voxel jitter and baked AO
  (RGBA8), `CUSTOM1.r` = team mask, `CUSTOM1.g` = glow; triangles already in
  Godot's clockwise winding. Shade with `game/core/voxel.gdshader`
  (`VoxelModels.material()` / `team_material(color, instanced)`): albedo *
  mix(1, team colour, team), emission = albedo * glow * 2.5; with
  `use_instance_team` the MultiMesh custom data is (linear team rgb, hit flash).
  Names: `units/<type>/<part>`, `buildings/<type>/<variant>`,
  `construction/<type>/<variant>/<stage 0..7>`, `props/<kind>`,
  `resources/tree0..9|gold|berry` (+ `_shape` shadow-only twins),
  `details/tuft0..4|flowers0..3|pebbles0..2`, `economy/<key>` (the
  EconomyView keys), `combat/arrow|debris_*`.
- **Unit rigs**: `VoxelModels.rig(type)` = `{voxel, anim, style, euler: "XYZ",
  parts: [{name, anim (channel), joint, parent, parentIdx, coat, portrait,
  conditional, mesh}]}`, parents first. Part world transform =
  `parent_world * Transform3D(Basis.from_euler(rot, EULER_ORDER_XYZ), joint * voxel)`
  (Godot's `EULER_ORDER_XYZ` equals Three's default `'XYZ'`, checked). Each
  part mesh is pivoted at its joint. `conditional` parts have a `show(u)` rule
  in `src/units/models.js` (tools, carried goods, gear variants) that the units
  piece reimplements.
- **Colours**: JS hex colours are sRGB; use `Color8`/`Color.hex` (sRGB) for
  material albedo and `source_color` uniforms; convert to linear for raw
  shader data (instance custom data).

## Piece contract (GDScript)

`game/main.gd` instances every existing `res://game/<piece>/<piece>.gd` in the
order `lighting, terrain, buildings, units, economy, combat, godpowers, ui`
as a child node (no edit to `main.gd` needed to add a piece), then:

- `setup(game)` once, after the sim world exists (`game.sim` is the `AovSim`,
  `game.camera` the `AovCameraRig`, `game.args` the parsed args,
  `game.scene_def` the scene entry, `game.pieces[name]` the other pieces);
- `frame(dt, alpha)` once per displayed frame, visual only.

The game loop (in `main.gd`) ticks `sim.tick(1)` at 30 Hz while not paused
(`live` scenes, or `--live=1`); a scene's `fast_forward` seconds are stepped
before the first frame. A scene setup is registered with
`AovScenes.set_setup(name, callable)`; it runs after all `setup()` calls and
returns a ctx Dictionary (`focus`, …).

## AovSim API (so far)

Lifecycle: `new_game(seed, map_size=128, preset="skirmish", players=2)`
(players Gaia / 1 "You" / 2 "Enemy", the map, the initial resources as
entities blocking their tiles), `tick(n=1)`, `get_tick()`, `get_time()`,
`get_seed()`, `version()`.

Map: `get_map_size()`, `get_map_cols()`, `get_water_level()`, `get_heights()`
(PackedInt32Array, cols*cols, row-major z then x), `get_ground()`
(PackedByteArray, `aov::Ground`), `get_passable()`, `get_walkable()`
(passable and not blocked: what A* sees), `height_at(x, z)`,
`smooth_height_at(x, z)`, `get_starts()` ([{owner, tx, tz}]),
`get_resource_spawns()` ([{type, tx, tz, variant}], the initial spawns),
`take_map_changes()`, `map_hash()`, `build_terrain_mesh(cx0, cz0, cx1, cz1)`
(Mesh arrays for a column rect: vertex, normal, linear colour, index).

Players: `add_player(id, name="", is_ai=true)` (owners 3..6),
`get_player(id)` ({id, name, is_ai, god, color, food, wood, gold, favor, pop,
pop_cap, age, age_name}), `get_player_ids()`, `is_enemy(a, b)`.

Entities: `unit_type_names()` (type index -> key), `get_unit_def(key)`,
`spawn_unit(type, owner, x, z, rot=0)` -> id, `spawn_block(type, owner,
count, x, z, cols=0, spacing=1, rot=0, jitter=0.15)` -> ids (helpers.js
spawnBlock), `spawn_resource(type, tx, tz, variant=0)`, `remove_resource(id)`,
`clear_rect(tx, tz, w, h)`, `kill_unit(id, killer=0)` (minimal: dead, hp 0,
stop, `entity:died`; combat will own the real one), `entity_kind(id)` (0
none, 1 unit, 2 building, 3 resource), `get_unit_count()`, `get_unit(id)`
(one unit as a Dictionary incl. its remaining path: UI / debugging only),
`units_near(x, z, r, owner=-1)`.

Per-frame state, one call each, parallel arrays (index i = one entity):
- `get_units()`: `count`, `ids` (Int32), `pos` / `prev_pos` (Float32, x,z
  pairs), `rot` / `prev_rot`, `ground_y` (terrain height under pos), `type`
  (Byte, index into `unit_type_names()`), `owner`, `hp`, `max_hp`, `anim`
  (Byte: 0 idle, 1 walk, 2 gather, 3 build, 4 worship, 5 attack, 6 die),
  `anim_t`, `attack_t`, `die_t`, `hit_t` (-1 = never hit), `flash_t`,
  `order` (Byte: 0 idle, 1 move, 2 gather, 3 dropoff, 4 worship, 5 build,
  6 attack), `target` (order target id), `flags` (Byte: 1 moving, 2 dead,
  4 arrived, 8 carrying, 16 battle line), `carry` (Byte resource kind, 255
  none).
- `get_buildings()`: `count`, `ids`, `type`, `owner`, `rect` (tx,tz,w,h),
  `hp`, `max_hp`, `built`, `progress`.
- `get_resources()`: `count`, `ids`, `type` (index into `type_names`:
  tree, gold, berry), `tile` (tx,tz), `amount`, `variant`, `type_names`.

Commands: `order(id, {type, target, x, z, a, b, c})`, `order_move(ids, x, z)`
(formation move), `order_idle(ids)`, `smart(ids, x, z, target_id=0)`
(right-click; order types whose piece is not ported yet fall back to a
move), `move_to(id, x, z, range=0)`, `find_path(sx, sz, gx, gz)`
(PackedVector2Array), `set_group_paths(min_units)`, `set_repath_budget(n)`,
`set_path_cache(on)`.

Events (`game.events`, drained by main.gd): [{type, id, kind, other, owner,
a, x, z, amount}], type one of `entity:added` (a = type index),
`entity:removed`, `entity:died` (other = killer), `unit:damaged`,
`building:placed`, `building:completed`, `unit:trained`, `age:advanced`,
`resources:changed`, `godpower:cast`, `command:smart` (other = target, a =
unit count), `game:over`; `set_record_events(on)`. C++ systems subscribe
with `sim.events.on(EV_…, fn)`.

Profiling / checks: `set_profiling(on)`, `get_profile()`, `get_stats()`
({alive, dead, moving, buildings, projectiles, resources, paths, path_calls,
path_searches, path_cache_hits, path_expanded, group_fields, …}),
`set_census(on)` / `take_census()` (spatial-hash queries), `units_hash()`,
`get_units_f64()` (full-precision dump for parity tools).

Add methods in `aov_sim.{h,cpp}` next to the piece's section and list them here.

## Status

- Done (foundation): project, GDExtension + `AovSim`, model export (all JS
  models incl. unit rigs), capture and bench scripts.
- Done (sim core A): bit-exact map generator for every preset and player
  count; entity store, players (Gaia + 6), events, spatial hash, A* with
  line-of-sight smoothing (+ exact path cache), movement (separation,
  sliding, stuck re-paths), units spawn / anim state / spread / corpse
  clearing, commands (idle, move, formation move, smart), all bit-exact with
  the browser (`check-sim.mjs`: 4200 units over 900 ticks match; C++ 1.7
  ms/tick vs JS 31 ms). First-pass terrain (C++ chunk mesher with the JS
  palette and AO) and a sim debug view.
- Placeholders to replace: `game/terrain/terrain.gd` (first pass: no shore
  smoothing, talus, cliff relief, water shader or ground details),
  `game/lighting/lighting.gd`, `game/core/sim_debug.gd` (until the units
  piece renders units).
